Employee Management
BlueNeck allows you to add employees so that you do not have to do everything on your own.

You can permit your employees and restrict them to use certain menus and modules.

You can also create hotel-wise permissions. So that the employee managing a hotel does not see the other hotels.

For employee management, we have three options under the Administration Tab. These tabs are Employees, Profile, and Permissions.

Employees
With the help of this Menu, you can create, edit, and delete employees in your system. One employee gets created in the system when you install it. This is the super admin of the system. You cannot delete this employee.

To add an Employee click on Add New Employee.

Then you also have two options on this page,

Password regeneration: If an employee regenerates his password then after how many minutes he can do it again
Memorize the language used in Admin panel forms: The system will memorize the language used by the employee in his admin panel

Permissions
Once you have created the Profile you will have to design its permissions. Go to the Administration →Permissions

Administation and permision
When you design the permission then first you select the Profile then you give him the following permission.  

Hotel Permission: You can decide which hotel this profile can access. If you assign a profile to a profile for one hotel.

Then the employee of that profile will not be able to see any other hotels. He checks the room types, orders, price rules, and customers of his hotel only.

If there is a price rule in which there are room types of multiple hotels. If this employee’s room type is also there then he views that price rule and edits only those fields that are related to his hotel.  

Menu Permissions: In this section, you can decide the menu permissions per profile. For each of the menu criteria, you have 5 options:

View: view information.
Add: add new information.
Edit: change information.
Delete: delete information.
All: all the above options for the current row.
Based on the above criteria, you can decide on the menu and sub-menu permission.   Module Permission: In this section, you can decide which module the employee can access based on three criteria.

View: The employee can view the module’s configuration.
Configure: The employee can configure the module.
Uninstall: The employee can uninstall the module
But remember that if you are giving them permission for any module then give him the permission of module and service tab or any other relevant tab then only he will be able to access it.
